# CT-Scan-Brain-Tumor-Cancer-Aneurysm-Classification
## Introduction

Welcome to the CT-Scan-Brain-Tumor-Cancer-Aneurysm-Classification project! This repository contains code for a machine learning model that classifies brain CT scan images to detect brain tumors, cancer, and aneurysms. The project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze medical images and provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle at the following location: [CT Scan of the Brain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/computed-tomography-ct-of-the-brain). It includes a collection of brain CT scan images along with corresponding labels for brain tumor, cancer, and aneurysm classification. To use this code, you should download the dataset from the Kaggle link.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for the classification of medical images. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze brain CT scans and determine whether they contain indications of brain tumors, cancer, or aneurysms. The model's predictions can assist medical professionals in diagnosing and treating patients more accurately.
